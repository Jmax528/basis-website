<p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee
    should be able to fly.
    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
    The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care
    what humans think is impossible.
    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>
